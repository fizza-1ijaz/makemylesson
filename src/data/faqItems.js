    q: 'What is Make My Lesson?',
    a: `Make My Lesson is an AI-powered lesson planning platform built specifically for classroom teachers. It generates complete, curriculum-aligned teaching packs from a single curriculum selection and a single topic — covering a lesson plan, a classroom presentation, a student activity with teacher answer key, and a summative assessment with mark scheme.

Unlike generic AI writing tools, Make My Lesson is a purpose-built teacher planning platform. Every output is calibrated to your exact curriculum route, grade level, subject, and teaching method — not a generic template that ignores your exam board's language, your state's syllabus authority, or your programme's assessment conventions.

In one sentence: Select your curriculum. Type your topic. Receive a complete, classroom-ready teaching pack in minutes.`,

    q: 'What does Make My Lesson generate?',
    a: `Make My Lesson generates four connected stages of teaching content, which together form a complete teaching pack:

Stage 1 — Lesson Plan: A fully structured, curriculum-aligned lesson plan including learning objectives in your curriculum's exact outcome language, a sequenced teaching structure, Bloom's Taxonomy alignment, differentiation strategies, formative assessment check, and homework task.

Stage 2 — Classroom Presentation: A classroom-ready slide deck with curriculum-accurate content, per-slide speaker notes, and AI-generated educational images. Duration drives slide count (30 min = 6 slides, 60 min = 12 slides). Exports to PPTX, PDF, Google Classroom, and Microsoft Teams.

Stage 3 — Classroom Activity: A formative activity set — always two separate documents: a student-facing activity sheet and a teacher answer key. 17 question types, 5 activity formats, Support / Core / Stretch difficulty tracks.

Stage 4 — Summative Assessment: A complete assessment paper with a detailed teacher mark scheme — always two separate documents. Bloom's Taxonomy balancing applied automatically. 6 duration options, 5–50 mark range.

All four stages can be used together as a complete teaching pack or independently as standalone tools.`,

    q: 'Who is Make My Lesson for?',
    a: `Make My Lesson is built for classroom teachers across all supported curriculum systems and year levels:

Primary and early years teachers who need curriculum-aligned activities without hours of resource creation
Secondary and senior teachers who need exam-board-specific lesson plans, structured assessment papers, and formative activity sets
International school teachers working across IB programmes who need criterion-aligned, inquiry-informed resources
New and early-career teachers who need a reliable scaffold for lesson planning and assessment design
Experienced teachers who want to save preparation time without compromising curriculum quality
Heads of department and curriculum leads who need consistent, curriculum-faithful planning tools across their teams`,

    q: 'Is Make My Lesson just a lesson plan generator?',
    a: `No. Make My Lesson is a complete teacher planning platform — a software replacement for the five or more separate tools most teachers currently use to prepare one complete lesson. It handles lesson planning, presentation building, classroom activity creation, summative assessment design, export, and library management in one connected workflow.

A generic AI tool generates text. Make My Lesson generates structured, curriculum-specific teaching resources with separate student and teacher documents, Bloom's Taxonomy balancing, AI-generated educational images, and direct classroom integration — calibrated to your exact curriculum route.`,

    q: 'How does Make My Lesson save teachers time?',
    a: `The average teacher works 49 hours a week — 10 hours above their contracted hours. Most of those extra hours go to exactly the tasks Make My Lesson handles.

A complete teaching pack — lesson plan, presentation, activity, and assessment — typically takes a teacher 2.5 to 5 hours to build from scratch across five different tools. Make My Lesson generates the same complete pack in under 10 minutes.

Before Make My Lesson:
Lesson plan (30–60 min) + Presentation (45–90 min) + Activity + answer key (30–60 min) + Assessment + mark scheme (60–90 min) = 2.5–5 hours. Across 5 tools that don't talk to each other.

With Make My Lesson:
All four stages. One curriculum selection. Under 10 minutes. Every document coherent, aligned, and classroom-ready.`,

    cat: 'cat1',
    catTitle: 'Category 1 — What Is Make My Lesson?',
    q: 'Do I have to generate all four stages every time?',
    a: `No. Every stage is fully independent. You can generate any single stage without using the others:

Generate only a lesson plan (Stage 1) if that is all you need
Generate only a presentation (Stage 2) using your own existing lesson plan
Generate only a classroom activity (Stage 3) for any topic
Generate only a summative assessment (Stage 4) without completing the other stages

When you use stages in sequence — for example, generating a presentation after a lesson plan — the curriculum context carries over automatically. You never have to re-select your curriculum, grade, or subject between stages.`,

    catTitle: 'Category 1 — What Is Make My Lesson?',
    q: 'What makes Make My Lesson different from ChatGPT or other generic AI tools?',
    a: `Generic AI tools generate text. Make My Lesson generates structured, curriculum-specific teaching resources. The difference is significant.

A generic AI tool gives you a lesson plan-shaped paragraph — content that sounds educational but is not calibrated to your curriculum authority, your grade level's expected language, your exam board's command words, or your assessment conventions. Make My Lesson generates content specifically built for your route: a NSW HSC output uses NESA language, a GCSE output applies your exam board's assessment objectives, an IB DP output maintains programme-specific pedagogy.

Make My Lesson also generates four connected documents in a structured workflow — lesson plan, presentation, activity and assessment — and always produces two separate documents for Stages 3 and 4: a student-facing sheet and a teacher-only answer key or mark scheme. No generic AI tool does this.`,

    q: 'What does Stage 1 generate — the Lesson Plan?',
    a: `Stage 1 generates a fully structured, curriculum-aligned lesson plan from your curriculum selection, grade level, subject, topic, teaching method, and lesson duration. Every lesson plan includes:

Prior Knowledge Assumed — curriculum-relevant prerequisite knowledge
Learning Objectives — 3–5 measurable objectives in your curriculum's exact outcome language and command verbs
Starter / Hook Activity — materials, setup steps, learning purpose, and timing
Main Teaching Activity — full explanation, modelling, and guided practice sequence with your teaching method embedded throughout
Differentiation — scaffolding, extension, and pacing strategies
Assessment for Learning — a specific formative check question or task
Homework / Next Step — a clear task with purpose and expectation, route-specific framing

This is not a template with blanks to fill in. It is a complete, classroom-ready lesson plan written specifically for your route, your grade, and your topic.`,

    q: 'What does Stage 2 generate — the Classroom Presentation?',
    a: `Stage 2 generates a classroom-ready presentation deck built around your lesson plan. Every slide has a specific teaching job — hook, concept explanation, worked example, guided practice, discussion, or plenary — not a generic summary.

Slide count is driven by lesson duration and is fixed:
30 min → 6 slides  ·  35 min → 7 slides  ·  40 min → 8 slides
45 min → 9 slides  ·  50 min → 10 slides  ·  55 min → 11 slides  ·  60 min → 12 slides

Every deck includes curriculum-accurate content, per-slide speaker notes, and AI-generated educational images on slides where they have the highest learning value. Learning Objectives slides are always text-only by design.

Three presentation styles are available: Standard Classroom Slides, Visual-Focused Slides, and Discussion-Driven Slides. Export to PPTX, PDF, Google Classroom, or Microsoft Teams.`,

    q: 'What does Stage 3 generate — the Classroom Activity?',
    a: `Stage 3 generates a formative classroom activity set. Every Stage 3 generation always produces two separate documents, without exception:

Student Activity Sheet — activity title, curriculum label, grade, subject, topic, all questions and tasks. Answers excluded completely. This is what students receive.

Teacher Answer Key — all questions repeated for reference, plus correct answers, marking guidance, purpose type per item, and difficulty level. Teacher-facing only.

Teachers choose their activity format (Quick Check, Practice Worksheet, Guided Activity Set, Exit Ticket, or Discussion + Written Response), question types from 17 available types, and a difficulty track (Support, Core, Stretch, or Mixed).

No more building a worksheet and separately writing the answer key. Both arrive together.`,

    q: 'What are the 17 question types available in Stage 3?',
    a: `Stage 3 supports 17 question types across four groups:

Recall & Knowledge: Multiple Choice, True / False, Fill in the Blanks, Matching
Application & Skill: Short Answer, Sequencing / Ordering, Problem Solving / Multi-Step, Error Analysis / Find the Mistake
Data & Source Interpretation: Diagram Labelling, Graph / Chart Interpretation, Table / Data Analysis, Source / Document Analysis, Case-Based Question
Higher Order & Extended: Compare and Contrast, Explain Your Reasoning, Extended Response, Practical Reflection / Exit Reflection`,

    catTitle: 'Category 2 — How It Works — The Four Stages',
    q: 'What does Stage 4 generate — the Summative Assessment?',
    a: `Stage 4 generates a curriculum-aligned summative assessment — a paper a teacher could print, hand out, and mark in a real classroom. Every Stage 4 generation always produces two separate documents:

Student Assessment Paper — questions with mark allocations, instructions, and section headers
Teacher Mark Scheme — model answers, marking criteria, acceptable answer variants, and marks per question

Duration options: 15, 20, 30, 40, 45, or 60 minutes. Mark range: 5 to 50 marks. Question type families: Objective, Short Response, Structured Response, Extended Response, and Visual / Data Response.

This is the stage that replaces the most preparation time. Designing a proper assessment paper with a mark scheme from scratch typically takes a teacher 60–90 minutes. Make My Lesson generates both in minutes.`,

    cat: 'cat2',
    catTitle: 'Category 2 — How It Works — The Four Stages',
    q: "How does Bloom's Taxonomy balancing work in Stage 4?",
    a: `Bloom's Taxonomy balancing is applied automatically to every Stage 4 assessment — you do not set it manually. The distribution is calculated based on your assessment duration and curriculum route.

For example, a 60-minute assessment distributes marks approximately 18% Remember, 24% Understand, 25% Apply, 22% Analyse, and 11% Evaluate. Short assessments (15–20 minutes) exclude Evaluate-level questions because those question types cannot be answered meaningfully in a short time. This prevents the common problem of assessments that only test recall, or papers that accidentally skip application.`,

    q: 'What are the 16 teaching methods and how are they embedded?',
    a: `Make My Lesson supports 16 teaching methods. When you select a method, it shapes how every section of every document is structured — not just labelled:

General (Teacher-Led Instruction) · Flipped Classroom · Blended Learning · Gamification
Project-Based Learning · Inquiry-Based Learning · Collaborative Learning · Personalised Learning
Competency-Based Learning · Experiential Learning · Mindfulness & SEL · Spaced Learning
Service Learning · Problem-Based Learning · Crossover Learning · Kinesthetic Learning

Select Inquiry-Based Learning and every output is built around questions, discovery, and student exploration. Select Collaborative Learning and every activity includes structured pair and group work. The method shapes the output — it does not merely appear as a label at the top.`,

    q: 'What is a complete teaching pack?',
    a: `A complete teaching pack is the result of generating all four stages for the same topic. It produces seven classroom-ready documents covering every phase of the teaching and assessment cycle:

1. Lesson Plan (teacher)
2. Classroom Presentation PPTX (teacher + students)
3. Speaker Notes PDF (teacher only)
4. Student Activity Sheet (students)
5. Teacher Answer Key (teacher only)
6. Student Assessment Paper (students)
7. Teacher Mark Scheme (teacher only)

Total credit cost: 4 credits. Total preparation time: under 10 minutes. All documents are coherent, aligned to the same curriculum route, and downloadable as a single ZIP file.`,

    cat: 'cat2',
    catTitle: 'Category 2 — How It Works — The Four Stages',
    q: 'Are the outputs generic or curriculum-specific?',
    a: `Every output is calibrated to the teacher's exact curriculum route, grade level, subject, and topic. A NSW HSC output uses NESA's outcome language and assessment conventions. A GCSE output applies AQA, OCR, Edexcel, or WJEC command words depending on the selected board. A VCE output reflects VCAA's study design framing. An IB MYP output uses criterion-referenced assessment language and ATL skills.

No two curriculum routes share a generic output. This is the core reason Make My Lesson is a software replacement for generic AI tools, not a variation of them.`,

    q: 'Is Make My Lesson designed for Australian teachers specifically?',
    a: `Yes. Australian teachers are among the most underserved by international lesson planning tools — most tools are built around US frameworks and produce output that ignores Australian state authorities entirely.

Make My Lesson covers all 8 states and territories across Primary (Years 1–6), Secondary (Years 7–10), and Senior Certificate levels. Every Australian output is calibrated to your state authority — NESA for NSW, VCAA for Victoria, QCAA for Queensland, SCSA for WA, SA DfE for South Australia, TQA for Tasmania, ACT BSSS for ACT, and NT DoE for Northern Territory. Certificates supported include HSC, VCE, QCE, WACE, SACE, TCE, ACT Senior Secondary, and NTCET.`,

    a: `Yes. UK teachers have 14 curriculum routes available across three exam bodies — UK National Curriculum (DfE), Cambridge International (CAIE), and Pearson Edexcel.

Every output applies the specific board's terminology, command words, and assessment objectives automatically. AQA, OCR, Edexcel, and WJEC conventions are applied without the teacher needing to check board-specific language manually.

    a: `Yes. Make My Lesson supports all three IB programmes — PYP, MYP, and Diploma Programme — with programme-specific pedagogy built into every output:

IB PYP: No exam-style questions. No formal assessment language. Homework takes the form of inquiry extensions or family connections. ATL skills and key concepts are embedded throughout.

IB MYP: Criterion-referenced assessment framing, global contexts, conceptual understanding, and ATL skills embedded. No DP-style assessment language is used.

IB DP: HL and SL are strictly separated. DP outputs include greater depth, abstraction, and synthesis at HL. No official past paper reproduction.

IB teachers are among the hardest-working professionals in education. Their resources need to reflect genuine IB pedagogy — not generic content with IB labels attached. Make My Lesson's IB outputs are programme-specific throughout.`,

    a: `Yes. Canada has 24 curriculum routes covering eight province and territory groups across three levels (Elementary, Grades 7–10, and Senior). Every province uses its own terminology and framework — and Make My Lesson applies the right language automatically:

Ontario: Strand and Specific Expectation language (OSSD)
British Columbia: Big Idea and Curricular Competency language (Dogwood Diploma)
Alberta: General Outcome (GLO) and Specific Outcome (SLO) language (Alberta Diploma)
Quebec: Competency and Cycle structure language (QEP / MEES)

    q: 'What is saved in My Library?',
    a: `Every generated document saves automatically to My Library. Content is organised across six tabs:

All Packs — every generation, sorted by most recent
Complete Packs — topics where all four stages have been generated, with ZIP download
Lesson Plans — all Stage 1 generations
Presentations — all Stage 2 generations
Activities & Assessments — all Stage 3 and Stage 4 generations
Favourites — everything you have starred, across all stages

You can search by topic name, subject, or curriculum route, and filter by stage, date range, or difficulty.`,

    q: 'Can I edit my generated content manually?',
    a: `Yes. Manual editing is always free and never consumes a credit. You can edit any section of any generated document at no cost. Only a full AI stage regeneration — creating a completely new version of a stage — uses 1 credit. Ayla can also help you make targeted changes without triggering a full regeneration.`,

    q: 'Can I post directly to Google Classroom or Microsoft Teams?',
    a: `Yes. Every document type supports direct posting to Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams. For student-facing documents (Student Activity Sheet, Student Assessment Paper), you can post directly to your class. For teacher-only documents (Answer Key, Mark Scheme, Speaker Notes), posting routes to the teacher-only section. No downloading, re-uploading, or reformatting required.`,

    q: 'Can I use Make My Lesson on mobile?',
    a: `Yes. Make My Lesson is available on web, iOS, and Android. Your library and generated content sync across all your devices. Your saved curriculum selection is preserved between sessions so you do not have to re-select your route each time.`,

    q: 'Does Make My Lesson guarantee official exam-board papers or grade outcomes?',
    a: `No. Make My Lesson does not claim to generate official exam papers, does not reproduce official past papers, and does not guarantee specific grade outcomes. Every generated output includes a mandatory verification footer:

"Content generated aligns with [curriculum name and route]. Always verify against current official documentation and adapt to your learners' needs."

This is not legal boilerplate. It is a genuine acknowledgement that AI generation is a starting point, not a final product. Your professional knowledge of your students, your classroom, and your school context is what makes a teaching pack come to life.`,

    q: 'Do I still need to review the generated content before using it?',
    a: `Yes. Make My Lesson is designed to handle the structural, time-consuming generation work so that the professional time you spend on lesson preparation is focused on quality, adaptation, and your learners — not on typing out objectives, formatting slide decks, and writing mark schemes from scratch.

Generated content should be reviewed with your professional judgement before classroom use. You know your students, their prior knowledge, and their specific needs better than any AI platform. Ayla is available to help you refine any content instantly, for free, before it goes into your classroom.`,

    q: 'What is the simplest way to describe Make My Lesson?',
    a: `Select your curriculum. Type your topic. Receive a complete, classroom-ready teaching pack in minutes.

Make My Lesson is the AI lesson planning platform that replaces the 2–3 hours of preparation most teachers spend building a lesson plan, a presentation, a classroom activity, and an assessment across five separate tools — and generates all four in one connected workflow, calibrated to your exact curriculum, every time.`,
